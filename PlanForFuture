There are certain things which we plan to write on our own in order to increase our understanding of operating system and gain more experience 
in creating great programs using C++, my favorite language.

1. Write a debugger which can be used to keep a watch on a process running on same machine and then give informaition lile stack entries,
threads created, time for all the threads and the process has been alive

2. Write a sample application to demonstrate and understand the working of names pipes. how they work and how they will help you understand
essense of it

3. Write an appilcation which makes use of Sqlite API's which we could use for gain understanding of Sqlite Engine and use C++ AMP to
accelarate the processing of all the information which is returned from the Sqlite API's.


Above is all the stuff which we have planned for the future assignments which we will undertake in the phased manner.
